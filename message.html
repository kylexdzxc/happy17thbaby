      <p>
      i want you to know how special you are to me. you bring joy sa buhay ko. i'm so grateful to have you in my life. i hope you're surrounded by everything and everyone you love, iwas
      sa mga negative people, ha?
      may this year brings you happiness, success, laughter kasama ako kahit na most of the time ay magulo po tayo. 
        you are such a beautiful soul, inside and out. iâ€™ve seen how you love, how you give, how you stay strong kahit sobrang hirap na minsan. </p>
        <p>
        thank you for being you, love. nakikita ko na palagi mong binibigay ang best mo sa lahat ng things. hindi ko man palagi nasasabi sayo but i hope you know that i am so proud of youâ€”sa lahat ng ginagawa mo. wala kang kailangan gawin to make me proud, proud ako kasi you're you. i admire every little things about you, kahit yung mga hate mo sa sarili mo, love ko po un. </p>
        <p>
        iâ€™m wishing you all the best sa bagong taon ng buhay mo. sana lahat ng goals and dreams natin ay ma-achieve po natin together, kahit na may failure minsan, okay lang po un kasi part yan ng growth. nandito lang ako palagi, to cheer for you n to love you no matter what. gustomg gusto na kita makasama. im really looking forward sa araw na magkatabi na tayo, kahit na matagal pa po yon, worth it naman ang pag-wwait. you made everything worthwhile, love love. u made my life worthwhile.</p>
        
        
        today is your dayâ€”and even though i canâ€™t be there in person to celebrate with you, i hope u know na im celebrating from the heart kasi happy happy po ako na 17 na ikaw. <b>SEVENTEEN</b>, huh? you're growing up so beautifully, baby. sobrang lucky ko po na meron akong ikaw! like what did i even do to deserve someone like you?!
       
        <p>
        you have no idea how proud i am sayo. iâ€™ve watched you grow little by little. you've gone through so much and still managed to stay pure, sweet, loving, and kind. ang dami mong pinagdaanan, pero andito ka pa rinâ€”strong, kind, and still that funny, lovable person i fell for. uindi ko alam kung paano mo nagagawa yon, pero parang lagi kang may magic na nagpapagaan ng araw ko. nagkakasakitan po tayo minsan pero ang soft mo pa rin. alam mo po, palagi akong nagsisisi na nasasaktan ko ikaw. it hurts me too knowing na nasasaktan ko ikaw and nabibigyan kita ng sakit sa ulo, dahil wala po akong ibang gusto kundi ang best for you. </p>
        
        i wish i could just teleport to where you are, hug you tight, and tell you how much i love you, bebe, without needing to say a word, but somehow, even through all the distance, you still manage to make me feel close to you. feel na feel ko yung presence mo kahit sobrang layo natin sa isa't isa kasi you never fail to make me feel loved kahit na nag aaway tayo. i love being loved by youuuuu.
        
        <p>ik weâ€™re not in the same place right now, it sucks sometimes. i wish I could be there to celebrate with you, hold your hand, n show up, but bebe, even from here, i want you to know na youâ€™re the most important person in my life. no amount of distance changes that.</p>
        
        i hope you feel all the love you deserve. deserve mo po love mag celebrate, deserve mong maging masaya buong araw kaya go ahead n eat your favorite food or do the things na makakapagpasaya sayo since its your day. hindi lang dapat tuwing birthday mo ikaw masaya, but all the time. mahal na mahal kita.
        
        <p>you are literally the best thing that ever happened to my life, you're the best part, indeed. thank you for everything that you've done, thank you for coming into my life and for making it so much worthwhile. thank you kasi kahit may mga araw na busy, pagod, n so on, u still manage na bigyan ako ng time. never ikaw nag fail. </p>
        
        bebe, 17 ka na, isipin mo un. one year na lang, legal ka na n pwede na tayong magkita. kahit maging ilang taon k pah in the future,for me, baby pa rin ikaw. i love you so much, ang ganda ganda mo. my baby be so beautiful not just physically but the way you treat people with kindness, the way you laugh, sobrang ganda, nakaka inlove, n your heart, sobrang pure n lastly; the way you make me feel like im worth something.
