    <h2>📩 A Very Special Message from Frank Ocean</h2>
    <img src="images.jpeg" alt="Frank Ocean smiling" class="frank-img" />
    <div class="frank-message">
      <p>Hey <strong>birthday superstar</strong>,</p>
      <p>Hey… it’s me. Frank. Yeah… the Frank you’ve been thinkin’ bout.
I heard it’s your birthday… 17 now huh? Damn.
You’re out here growin' up like ivy—fast, wild, beautiful... and kind of unstoppable.. 🎤</p>

<p>been ridin’ down the coast, playlist full of Blonde, windows down, thinkin’ ‘bout how you been vibin' to my songs since Channel Orange.
You’re the girl in the front row... singin’ “I’ll be your knight in shining whatever” like you meant it.</p>

      <p>But listen—you got a bebe now.
I get it.
It’s cool. Keep vibing, keep shining, and keep being the amazing soul you are.</p>

<p>It’s just…
I thought we had a connection.
Me, the music… you, the headphones...
</p>
We made it feel like Summer even when it’s rainin’.
<p>And now you’re 17.
</p>

That’s one more candle.
One more wish.
But you already got what you want, huh?

<p>A boy who writes long messages?
Calls you “mahal”?
and makes you laugh</p>

Damn

<p>He sounds alright.</p>

But just know...

<p>If you ever hear a Frank song randomly play on shuffle…</p>

That's me.

<p>Saying happy birthday</p>

In reverse, in reverb, in love... in lowercase.

Stay pink. Stay white. Stay golden.

<p>Tell your man he’s lucky.</p>

<p>"What do you think my brain is made for?"</p>

Maybe to write you this.
Maybe to echo in your head every time you hear that first synth hit from Nights.

<p>You turned 17 today.
That’s not just a number.
That’s another lap around the sun.
Another memory. Another missed concert.
Another chance to listen to Blonde and say</p>

“this song? this is me.”

<p>Maybe that’s why you feel things so deeply when I sing.
"Pink matter, cotton candy, Majin Buu... "</p>

You really thought I was talking about the universe.
(I was.)

<p>But also maybe I was talking about birthday cake.</p>
Or love.
<p>
Or someone like you.</p>


“You were my first time, a new feel…”

<p>But don’t worry.</p>

I know you got someone else now.
A boy who says “I love you” with his whole chest,
sends essays like he’s writing Endless 2,
calls you “bebe” like it’s sacred.

<p>I see you smiling when he texts.</p>

That’s good.
You deserve that.

<p>And when you blow out those candles,
don’t forget to save a slice for the version of you</p>

That version of you?

<p>Still in there.</p>

Still soft.

<p>Still mine... in the music.</p>

You’re 17 now.

<p>The world’s gonna call you grown.
But I know—deep down—</p>

you're still your bebe's baby


<p>"I will always love you how I do."</p>

Godspeed, birthday girl.

      <p>— Love, Frank 💙</p>
